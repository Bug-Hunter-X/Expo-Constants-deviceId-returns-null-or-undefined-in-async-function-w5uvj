This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Constants.deviceId` method within an asynchronous function. The `deviceId` might return `null` or `undefined` due to the asynchronous nature of the method and the timing of when it's called.  The code attempts to use this potentially null value leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.
