The solution is to ensure the `deviceId` is retrieved and checked before being used.  We can use async/await or Promises to handle the asynchronous operation effectively. 
Here's an example using async/await:
```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

export default function App() {
  const [deviceId, setDeviceId] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchDeviceId() {
      const id = await Constants.getDeviceIdAsync();
      setDeviceId(id);
    }
    fetchDeviceId();
  }, []);

  if (deviceId === null) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  } 

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Device ID: {deviceId}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
This revised code ensures the `deviceId` is retrieved asynchronously using `await` and is available before use.  The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `deviceId` while it's being fetched, displaying a 'Loading...' message until it's ready.
